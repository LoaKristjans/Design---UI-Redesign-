# Design-UI-Redesign. 
**Whitespace** - The header of the original site was quite packed and not much margin around it. I changed it and only picked a few items to have in the header to make it easier on the eye. For the Footer I created more margin space and added items instead.  
**Alignment** - For the Pictures (Logos) I created one main focus (Hero) and then had the other logos in a smaller size so it aligned better together.  
**Contrast** - With the help of designs.ai/colors I picket two green tones for header and footer.  
**Color** - Wanted a minimalistic look for the website, choose two greenish colors and had the text in either black or white.  
**Scale** - Scaling was the main focus of this redesign, I scaled the Pictures (Logos) differently from the original to let the design "breath" more.  
**Visual Hierarchy** - For all the Logos I put one photo as Hero and then had the other logos in a smaller size to create a Visual Hierachy. For the text I also created header with a smaller text underneath.
